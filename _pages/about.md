Hello! I am **Mu'ath Yousef**, a Cybersecurity Solutions Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud security, network defense, and AI-driven threat analysis. I am currently a senior student at **Tafila Technical University**, expected to graduate in 2025.

My passion lies in building resilient security architectures. I am currently working on **Project Synapse**, an AI-Driven Hybrid Security Data Platform designed to automate threat detection in modern SOC environments.

I have hands-on experience with:
* **Cloud Security:** AWS (S3 Hardening, IAM).
