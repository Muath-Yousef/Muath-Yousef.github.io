**Project Synapse** is a comprehensive SOC platform designed to automate threat detection using Artificial Intelligence.

### Core Objectives
The project aims to build a **Hybrid Security Data Platform** that moves beyond traditional detection by integrating a **Self-learning AI engine**.

### Execution Phases
1.  **Phase 1: MVP Development** - Building the core SOC functions and deploying on a single cloud environment to validate the architecture.
2.  **Phase 2: Full Architecture** - Scaling to a multi-cloud environment and releasing the project as an Open Source SOC Platform.
3.  **Phase 3: Intelligent Neural Core** - Implementing the continuous learning engine to generate new security rules autonomously.

### Technologies Used
* **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker Compose.
* **AI & Data:** Apache Spark, Machine Learning Models (Neural Units).
* **Security:** NIPS (Snort), SIEM Integration.
